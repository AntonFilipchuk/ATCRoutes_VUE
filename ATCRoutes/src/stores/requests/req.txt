1. Be able to fetch AIP routes - Done 
2. Be able to fetch coordinates of points - Done 
3. Be able to fetch custom routes with styles 
4. Be able to upload custom routes with styles 



FROM BD : (AIPRoutes + coordinates) => standard routes => to canvas 
FROM BD : (Custom routes) => to canvas



To display a route we need:
    1. Find bearing and distance from a center point (origin)
    2. Calculate cartesian coordinates that are normalized
    3. To normalize all coordinates we need to know bearing and distance 
    of all points.
    4. That's basically it - we have X and Y, Z, visuals.

To save a route we need: 
    1. Knowing normalized cartesian coordinates reverse calculations
    and get geographical coordinates
